# Data-Cleaning-Project

The goal of this task is to clean and prepare a raw dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and incorrect data types.

**Tools Used**

Python (Pandas)
Excel
Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

**Steps Performed**

Checked for missing values and handled them using .isnull() and .fillna().
Removed duplicate records using .drop_duplicates().
Standardized inconsistent text values (e.g., education, marital status).
Converted date columns to a consistent format (dd-mm-yyyy).
Renamed column headers for clarity and uniformity.
Verified and corrected data types (e.g.,object → datetime, int → Boolean).

**Summary**
The dataset was cleaned, formatted, and standardized for further analysis, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and readiness for visualization or modeling.
